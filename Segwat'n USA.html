I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: 
<dl>
<dt>Burma Shave Signs</dt>
<dd> Road signs common in the U.S. in the 1920s 
and 1930s advertising shaving products,</dd>
<dt>Route 66</dt>
<dd> Most famous road in the U.S. highway system.</dd>

</p>
<blockquote>
Passing cars, </br>When you can't see, </br>May get
you, </br>A glimpse, </br>of eternity."</br>
<p>
 I definitely won't be passing any cars.

My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I am on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, Ipod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials.
As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway</q>.
